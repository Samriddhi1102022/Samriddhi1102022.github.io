				About the Legend
			</h1>
			<br>
			<p>
				~~ He was student of Nalanda university, latter he even became head of one department of it. So Aryabhata got his major source of knowledge from Nalanda and his major work was based on previous inventions by Greeks, Mesapotamians and Nalanda university itself.
				<br><br>
				~~ Direct details of Aryabhata's work are known only from the <b>Aryabhatiya</b>. The name "Aryabhatiya" is due to later commentators. Aryabhata himself may not have given it a name. His disciple Bhaskara I calls it Ashmakatantra.
				<br><br>
				~~ <b>The Arya-siddhanta</b>, a lost work on astronomical computations, is known through the writings of Aryabhata's contemporary, Varahamihira, and later mathematicians and commentators, including Brahmagupta and Bhaskara I.
				<br><br>
				~~ The Aryabhatiya text consists of the 108 verses and 13 introductory verses, and is divided into four pādas or chapters which are Gitikapada, Ganitapada, Kalakriyapada and Golapada.
				<br><br> 
				~~ The place-value system, first seen in the 3rd-century Bakhshali Manuscript, was clearly in place in his work. While he did not use a symbol for zero, the French mathematician Georges Ifrah argues that knowledge of zero was implicit in Aryabhata's place-value system as a place holder for the powers of ten with null coefficients.
				<br><br> 
				~~ Aryabhata worked on the approximation for pi (π), and may have come to the conclusion that π is irrational. In the second part of the Aryabhatiyam (gaṇitapāda 10).
				<br><br> 
				~~ Aryabhata discussed the concept of sine in his work by the name of ardha-jya, which literally means "half-chord". For simplicity, people started calling it jya.
				<br><br> 
				~~ Diophantine equations have the form ax + by = c. Aryabhata's method of solving such problems, elaborated by Bhaskara in 621 CE, is called the kuṭṭaka (कुट्टक) method. Kuṭṭaka means "pulverizing" or "breaking into small pieces", and the method involves a recursive algorithm for writing the original factors in smaller numbers. 
				<br><br> 
				~~ In Aryabhatiya, Aryabhata provided elegant results for the summation of series of squares and cubes.
				<br><br> 
				~~ Aryabhata's system of astronomy was called the audAyaka system, in which days are reckoned from uday, dawn at lanka or "equator". Some of his later writings on astronomy, which apparently proposed a second model (or ardha-rAtrikA, midnight) are lost.
				<br><br> 
				~~ Aryabhata correctly insisted that the Earth rotates about its axis daily, and that the apparent movement of the stars is a relative motion caused by the rotation of the Earth, contrary to the then-prevailing view, that the sky rotated.[19] This is indicated in the first chapter of the Aryabhatiya, where he gives the number of rotations of the Earth in a yuga.
				<br><br> 
				~~ Aryabhata described a geocentric model of the Solar System, in which the Sun and Moon are each carried by epicycles. They in turn revolve around the Earth. In this model, which is also found in the Paitāmahasiddhānta.
				<br><br> 
				~~ The positions and periods of the planets was calculated relative to uniformly moving points. In the case of Mercury and Venus, they move around the Earth at the same mean speed as the Sun. In the case of Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, they move around the Earth at specific speeds, representing each planet's motion through the zodiac.
				<br><br> 
				~~ Solar and lunar eclipses were scientifically explained by Aryabhata. He states that the Moon and planets shine by reflected sunlight. Instead of the prevailing cosmogony in which eclipses were caused by Rahu and Ketu (identified as the pseudo-planetary lunar nodes), he explains eclipses in terms of shadows cast by and falling on Earth.
				<br><br> 
				~~ Considered in modern English units of time, Aryabhata calculated the sidereal rotation (the rotation of the earth referencing the fixed stars) as 23 hours, 56 minutes, and 4.1 seconds; the modern value is 23:56:4.091. Similarly, his value for the length of the sidereal year at 365 days, 6 hours, 12 minutes, and 30 seconds (365.25858 days)[33] is an error of 3 minutes and 20 seconds over the length of a year (365.25636 days).
				<br><br> 
				~~ Aryabhata advocated an astronomical model in which the Earth turns on its own axis. His model also gave corrections (the śīgra anomaly) for the speeds of the planets in the sky in terms of the mean speed of the Sun.
				<br><br><br>
				~~ Aryabhata's work was of great influence in the Indian astronomical tradition and influenced several neighbouring cultures through translations. The Arabic translation during the Islamic Golden Age (c. 820 CE), was particularly influential. Some of his results are cited by Al-Khwarizmi and in the 10th century Al-Biruni stated that Aryabhata's followers believed that the Earth rotated on its axis.
